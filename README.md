# Flask-Sock and HTMX example
Very short example to show the integration of [Flask-Sock](https://flask-sock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for self-updating web pages.   
HTMX files v1.6.1 are copied in the static folder for offline tests or deployments.  
Blog post on this at [Random Data Science](https://randomds.com/2022/03/25/self-updating-webpages-with-flask-and-htmx-no-refresh/).

Have fun!
